The notes correspond to the bachelor 
course \emph{Galois theory} of the 
Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
Faculty of Sciences, 
Department of Mathematics and Data Sciences. The course
is divided into thirteen two-hours lectures. 

The material is somewhat standard. Basic texts on fields and Galois theory 
are for example \cite{MR1645586}\dots

As usual, we also mention a set of great expository papers by 
Keith Conrad available at 
\url{https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/}. 
The notes are extremely well-written and are useful at  
at every stage of a mathematical career. 
 
Thanks go to Alejandro de la Cueva Merino.
