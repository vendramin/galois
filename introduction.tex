\section*{Introduction}

The notes correspond to the bachelor 
course \emph{Galois theory} of the 
Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
Faculty of Sciences, 
Department of Mathematics and Data Sciences. The course
is divided into twelve two-hour lectures. 

The material is somewhat standard. Basic texts on fields and Galois theory 
are for example \cite{MR1645586} and 
\cite{MR3379917}. 

As usual, we also mention a set of 
\href{https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/}{great expository papers} by 
Keith Conrad, the notes are extremely well-written and useful  
at every stage of a mathematical career. 

% Several chapters contain optional paragraphs that give examples of 
% how to apply \href{https://oscar.computeralgebra.de/}{OSCAR Computer Algebra System}
% to concrete problems in Galois theory. 

The notes include Magma code, which we use to verify examples and offer alternative solutions to certain exercises. Magma \cite{zbMATH01077111} is a powerful software tool designed for working with algebraic structures. There is a free \href{https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/}{online} version of Magma available.

Several of the exercise solutions were written by Silvia Properzi.
 
Thanks go to Wouter Appelmans, Andrew Darlington, Luca Descheemaeker, 
Alejandro de la Cueva Merino, 
Wannes Malfait, Manet Michiels, Silvia Properzi,
